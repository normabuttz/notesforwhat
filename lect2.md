## lecture 2
outline:
    - the painful process of becoming modernity
    - ornament.

A lot of time within this course will be spent looking at the painful time on becoming modern, so it will spend a lot of time between the period of 1880 and 1910. This is the  period when new technologies emerge, it takes time for a transition to those technologies where we are making use of them. Their usage, and what they can afford us is not apparent and work must be done. These transitional periods are important.

THe undercurrent for these lectures is still thinking about modernity as an ideology and not a style.

### What styles are, and what styles produce

- problems with traditions.
- buildings become pieces of evidence of how cultures transition. we can describe a culture by analyzing its architecture (materials, forms, how it deals with temperature)
- the transition to modernity will be different for europe, and north america. it doesn't happen uniformly or in the same way.

# the revolutionary road to modernism is modern life
- modernity isn't just a style that we superimpose onto things. it's a way of living.
- "The who basis of the views of architecture prevailing today must be displaced by the recognition that __the only possible point of departure for our artistic creation is modern life__" (Otto Wagner)

- Modernity wasn't just a rhetoric, it firmly believed that they could solve the the problems of modern life.

- As with Wagner's quote, the architects wanted to build from departing of what was their then conditions. They didn't copy or departed from classical buildings or temples, rather instead of focusing in reproducing the past, they focused on using architecture to address their current.
- if the architects weren't modern, they would just reproduce classical styles or impose styles into places rather than see their task in building as way to solve problems.
- modern life was life itself, modernism as an ideology attempted (which is what makes it an ideology) to address this with their forms. they aren't create for an aesthetic effect (which would be the case if they reproduce classical forms) when they create forms, rather the forms and buildings they make was to do something with being in this modern world.
    - they were literally designing ways of life, vechiles (and spaces) to produce these new ways of living and life.

### so being modern, the modern way of being was:
- about new ideas
- new forms
- new uses
- new building types
- new client
- new purposes
- and new ways of being in the world.

### Modernity = Rupture in history
- it represents a major break from a historical continuun based on two inter-related factories
    - it breaks away from history through an interpretation of an utopic (impossible) truth that denied being in history (a uptoia that was outside of historical conditions)
        - idea of designing a subway station is different from designing a school because a subway station at the time never existed, but if we were to design schools, and since these forms already exist, we would look at existing schools and find precedent in them.
- modernists believe because of new technology was in a vacuum and had no history, these new forms were totally broken away from the shackles of history, class and social structures
    - professor suggest that nothing is original, and everything is a combination of other things. design schools (though the ideal is great) wants to teach and encourage originality, but nothing is too original, everything has a history or precedent.
- The idea of precedent is huge in this part of architectural history and with a new materiality, there was no precedent (precedent was probably 'enforced' by clientings wanting you to do something, or you looking for existing solutions).
- In this period of design, with this new materiality that had no precedent, everything was possible because it had no connection or precedent in history, and that was the rupture, the break, from history.

### New Programs emerged
- How we are thinking about these changes, and connections.
- The modern movement was dependent on these "intellectualized" definitions of industrialization and society, and the new definitions of "use" it depended on.
- it make use of these concepts, or found use of them in building in a time where the materiality affording no precedent. I guess it could be like a guide-rail, like these concepts served as a guide to help encounter what they felt was beyond history and had no precedent, and what was connected to the way of living at the time.

### Modern movement
- they saw new classes, and power structures emerging that offered the opportunity for revolution.
- it suffered elitism
    - it's haunted by elitism
    - the modern forms that could be made by a modernist architects was only available to a small and elite segment of the population. most people couldn't afford what they were selling, their services.
    - modernism in other forms of arts, design and literature, could be seen as socially liberating but with architecture, the elites employed and could afford the architect and they never established a connection or serve or create something for those who they vowed to serve.
- they also suffered from universalism

### Where to begin?
- there is no clear beginning and no single country can claim credit that they started modernism

- so to locate modernity as an ideology and not a style, we can locate it by its conceptual origins. (i guess with a style we can locate it via its first appearance, rather than our current attempts of location modernity as a response to symptoms)

- It finds it origins in an idea of progress that is continual and always moving forward no matter what. We can say those that isn't the case today because endless progress can be seen as bad, and there are other questions about this concept of progress that erode our confidence with it, like is there really a single progress that everyone wants to get to (are we traveling the same way)?

- loss of confidence in Renaisssance traditions (those traditions, and the precedent they offer, was no longer seen as an useful)

- the loss of absolute authority (authority, there was no kings nor popes so building according to those patronages weren't necessary)

- new technologies on the scene

- industrialization created for a richer material world because things can be produced more, faster and better.

- the ideas or desires to see a social revolution fused with a material revolution that was happening because of the industrial revolution. ("there was all this great stuff, surely we can make the world more equitable")

### 1880-1920s

In this period, architects were cool. They were cool because they fulfilled a vacuum of needs that to be filled and they saw the technology, industrialization and a desire to create a new social order as something that seemed to fit the bill. They were the people who would give form and meaning to the future.

### Industrial revolution created opportunities
A wealthy industrialist doesn't want to show off the same things a new king would. An industrialist wanted different things, and architects still had to be paid. The industrial revolution brought new patrons to the architect who were from the middle and wealthy class.

The revolution also created opportunities for work in solving new problems and designing new building types (skyscrapers, railway stations).

New buildings and materials presented new opportunities on how to build buildings. Before these nw materials, we stacked buildings. These new materials presented new opportunities.

It also presented new opportunities by the sudden collapse of century-old traditions and guilds (masons, iron workers over generations) that were killed by the industrial revolution. If these century-old traditions and guilds existed, they would be the ones building buildings according to the ways they knew how. Architects would then be limited in how they could build. It's like using indigengious methods to make buildings vs other methods.

And power was structured in new urban economic centres. Before it was in palaces and like in versicales and cities would be stinky nasty places to store poor people but now cities have become the centre and not dumping grounds.  New opportunity to build for a new power that made the cities much more important.

The church, the state and the aristocracy was replaced by capital, money and industrialization.

### Changing world view
- things changed, new values appeared, like:.
- we used to use public spaces as places where we witness the expression of the power of the king (hangings, executions)
- but now public spaces have become important, it becomes for the people where they can stroll.


# "All revolutions are fought in the mind first, last and foremost"
- Because modernism is an ideology and not a style, buildings are arguments and reactions to things. THis means buildings can be built for political goals (shared public spaces, communal housing). "Buildings can respond to these things consciously and critically": meaning its the goal of the architecture to respond to these things. So buildings are basically arguments.



### SUPES IMPORTANT
    "The western enlightenment mind and its need to be 'rational' will systematize and close off many of the possibilities that modernity could have opened - this is why modernity will be called into question by post-modernity later"

pomo is a critique of the ideology of modernism (ideology = which is a collection of things how of modernism responded to those conditions). modernism is a response (and this is why it is an ideology) a condition but because of how it responded (with rationality being systematized) it closed off a lot of other possibilities. po-mo, also like modernity, is a critique of those conditions (a response to the conditions modernist made).

pomo can criticized the ideology of modernism because the ideology drove the creation of those conditions. the ideology emerged because it was responding to conditions that came before it (or rather responding to how different things were and how different things can be). pomo and modernism were both critical ideologies in that they didn't want to reproduce the then-current material forms.

### Univeriversalism and soundness
- Modernity as an ideology was seen as universally sound because it was based on humanity and reasoned. This is different from what traditions provided because traditions were always localized and historically dependent on place and time, and history (my grand ma from old country has been doing this for a thousand years, it must be right!).

- Modernity rests on its foundation on european enlightenment theory/belief that opinions and actions should be based on one's own reason and knowledge rather than the authority of the church or emotions.  (zuha, remember that wessely course on philosophy, anything u can remember is related to this)

    "Modernity creeps in as a __way of thinking__ that beings with a conscious stripping away of excess and references to forms and institutions using the pared down language of neoclassicism. The seeds of revolution are planted using historical western RATIONALISM"

- methods of abstraction rather than decoration, reducing rather than adding. this is the seeds of the modernism ideology but not yet modern.

### What are those steel beems replacing?
- always ask ourselves what those new materials replacing and what does that effect.

### St. Pancras Station, London.
- unlike wood, cast beams can create spans to create spaces can be 2000ft feet across.
- it was adjusted to local climate (red brick)
- in the inside it reinterpret the gothic concept of structure and skin. THey used new materials of steel to create spans but to keep the steel light, they gotta use cross beams/x-beams to keep it light. They organize the cross beams to create a pattern and they were referencing the gothic with buttresses.

So why was St. pancras using two forms with new material, using previously existing styes and refernecing them?

ANSWER: everyone was educated at ecole des Beaux-arts and had knowledge of these styles. The education there involved copying nude statues, copying greeks which didn't prepare people in their education on how to use steel and glass. They had to adapt and interpret these materials with things they already knew as taught by this school.

    "All revolutions need an institution to reject and work against so they can rally its troops."

Their solution to the problem against this school and the above was to pretend history never existed so they could start with a blank slate. They used this to rally their troops.

### New technologies looking for new forms
Cities were these architects experimented with these new forms. New forms because they weren't referencing history. So to build these new forms, they need new work. Though architects were experimenting with Paris, Glasgow, Vienna, Brussels and Barcelona, the tragic fire of Chicago gave them something on a whole other level.

"When new technologies showed up, what was being replace?"
- plate glass, steel concrete replaced:
- slow construction
- small windows
- guilds and master trades
- the pallete of wood, stone, carving, stacking, brick and nails.


### The skyscraper:
- between 1890 and 1905, Chicago prototyped and transformed architecture because it pumped out skyscrappers.
- skyscrappers were easy to build compared to previous materials and they were able to experiment with these materials to figure out how to do it.
- they were also provided with a blank slate both in terms of space by the fire and the need for a new type that had no precedent.
- in stacking, there no separation between structure and skin. the structure was the skin, the facade wasn't independent of what held the building together.

The idea of modernity was how it cuts history away completely because it views technological adaptation as a positive value, rather than seeing that one has to use new technologies to reference or reproduce the past. This is what separates modernity from other things.

### Europe in comparsion to Chicago

Europe was already developed, so modernism there was a time of renewal and not pure invention. Modernism had to respond to an environment where there was less room and no neutral grid (city road grid), where the cities were congested, dirty, overcrowed, had a bunch of problems.

- europe had different values then what was up in america
- they wanted new MODERN values, like
    - light
    - space
    - greenery
    - hygiene
    - transparency
    - mobility (social and architectural values; "give you a better life and give you mobility by making your body more mobile,"; the ideology mixed it).
- it was reforming the bad ways of the past,
    - they grew up in filthy cities and wanted to clean stuff up.
    - they were substractive. they saw their work as vehicle for reform.
- Art Nouveau
    - first part of of moerntiy transition but an expression of modernity
    - rejected historicism but not regional traditions, hated the beaux arts classicism
    - it was kinda of abstracted, it wasn't trying to copy the past forms like the greeks or romans styles.
    - it was non-regional.
    - it interpreted and became expressive with glass and metal as a means to put new forms
    - it drew from nature, and incorporated new materials and it reference nature because it couldn't reference classical stuff and kings (rejection of history)

    rejection of history = think about how it was done in the past and how  mpodernism was a rupture from that past, how it is done differently in such a way that it doesn't reference a past.
