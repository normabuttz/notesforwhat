### Lecture one
- what is modernism's deal?
    - contemporary is situated and located within the 1970s.
    - deconstructivism happened in the 80s.
    - in 1998, bring materiality back into things, in the age of neo-rationalism
    - modern architecture is a period of architecture we can view in retrospect, we can locate where it began and locate where it ends.
    - it seems to be the case that when goals have changed from that of modernism, people cease being modern. architectural modernism seems to be a set of goals these architects practiced but when they stop trying to achieve those goals, they stop being modern and they become something else.

### Modernism
- "Modern architecture was a formal and ideological resolution between an idealized vision of a new society + the unstoppable forces fueling the industrial revolution"

#### What killed or hurt modernism?
- what killed modernism was when the people realized the goals they were trying to achieve was not possible.
- world war two was the event that injured monderism. it was an event that changed the perspective people had towards technology, industrialization and this new society. They saw how technology was used to hurt people.
- another event was the realization and dissolution in the hope of a world society based on social equality.

- this period of ideology was a very hopeful period, it was filled with hopeful moments and expectations where architects believed that they can create a more just and fair society by erecting building. Architects saw themselves as social engineers, solving solution problems through construction of spaces.

### What about modernism?
- Before modernism, there was a history but when modernism came along, that history disappeared. Modernism was a rupture, not a continuation, in history. These objects, the intent behind their creation, it was a major departure from previous goals. "huge raptures in what we expect"

- instead of dealing with decoration, history, context and traditions, modernity pursued the myth of rationality through defining the "practical" definition of use by attaching it to a purposefulness.  

- rationality is a ruse! It's another set of games and rules just like previous eras of history had their set of rules and games, (aka traditions).

- how does this relate to the evolution of the technology.

- modernist believe everything they did was completely unique and only that they themselves could concieve of it. they saw themselves as working outside of the capacity of history because they saw themselves, functioning within their interpretation and knowledge of what is rational, as producing things that are based on this thing that escapes historical traditions. They want to pretend history doesn't exist, or that their work is untainted by precedent, or that they are transcending history.
    - modernist architects pretend history doesn't exist but they secretly study it.
    - mies van der rohe told people he learned how to build buildings from stone carving, but he never told people he studied all the histories and philosophies so his myth be truth.
    - he and other masters at the time wanted to promote the myth of creation without precedent.
    - these architects were interested in maintaining her brand and public persona.

### When did modernity start?
- It is hard to locate, it didn't start with a person.
- It started with the loss of confidence with what came before it. Modernity as an idea (and ideology) grew from the loss of confidence of Renaissance traditions, the loss of absolute authority.
- new industrial revolution meant new patrons with new money and intentions, so old patrons that valued those old ways no longer can support those old ways. 
- the industrial revolution created new problems and new building types (like factories, office buildings) because that's where the money was at.
    - new money = new motivation and new people who want different problem solved. 
- these new types had no precedent, they are a rupture from history. architects couldn't just go copy the greeks to build a train station because there was no train stations to copy. This meant that they were creating things without precedent because using new technologies that never existed before. they were, in many ways, breaking away from tradition because tradition simply didn't apply. New technology created for new opportunities for solutions (creating huge open spaces the span of a train because of steel) and new problems that needed to be solved (the train needing to board ppl).
    - new spatialities (the spaces created: wide open concept spaces with materials that can support weight vs narrow corridors constricted because of brick)
    - new program types (what the building does)
    - new technologies that has no precedent, we have had never seem them ever before. 
- Grids as a form of ideology is: logical, formal and rational. 
- collapse of vernacular traditions and craft. 

### Locating modernism by looking for symptoms
- Things started to get really excessive and getting really bad, and then that led to reform: rehab like.
- The ability to re-interpret and transform history because you don't have to recreate and copy history and you don't have to recreate and copy history because you got new patrons who want new things. This is a huge symptom that only modernists did.
    - the intent changed in how architecture was taught: instead of copying existing temples, you were to look at those temples and transform them and look for their singular idea. 
### Salt works
- taking history and abstracting it, putting materials to decorate it.
- made to create a space for workers to live.
- space is made (like how space is made through partitioning walls).
- he stripped things down and abstracted and limited it (like the columns and roofs) as an architectural response in reproducing those forms (he transform those forms: columns and roofs).

### What did these neoclassical rationalist seem to be saying to us (the non-aristocratic public)?
- superficial decorations are done
- archaic institutions are done
- hierachical and hegemonic things are done
- they forsee a more equal world.

### did everyone embrace modernity and this?
- nope, there was resistance to what they were saying. 
- There was institutional resistance
    -  Ecole des Beaux-Arts resisted modernism through the ways they were trained. Like the cranbrook academy that brought in professors from around the world to look at your work, and where you aren't taught theory or history so you can not be burden by it, the ecole des beaux-arts did the opposite. It forced you to analyze classical traditions and just copy things. It involved copy classical buildings or buildings built by the royalty

### The modernist fighting the resistance.
- the modernist saw the resistance to their ways in places like Ecole des Beaux-arts. 
- They felt it was up to them to clean this stuff up and push for reform. 

- we have this new technologies but archaic traditions, what do we do about with these new materials. this is what the modernist asked themselves. 

### Modernism is:

Modernism isn't a style. Its the intentions and the type of goals you are trying to achieve. A style could be a goal in how someone could sat they are trying to achieve a particular look but an ideology and the ideology of modernism is their goals they are trying to achieve in what they make.
